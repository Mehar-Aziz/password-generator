# Password Generator

This Python program generates a random password based on user-specified criteria, including letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Overview

The Password Generator allows you to customize the composition of your password by specifying:
- The number of letters (`nr_letters`)
- The number of symbols (`nr_symbols`)
- The number of numbers (`nr_numbers`)

It then randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers, shuffles them, and combines them into a secure password.
